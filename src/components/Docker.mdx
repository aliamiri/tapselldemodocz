# Dockers

I have a sigle docker-compose file which will deploy all the containers that are used in this project. 

- **Kafdrop, Kafka, Zookeeper** : I just did a little modification on an avaible docker compose for these three.

- **tapsellcassandra** : Used official cassandra image and add a bash script to create my keyspace.

- **tapsellbigdatahandler , generator** : Used alpine image and add respected jar files of my project.

- **nginx** : just a generic nginx container to act as a reverse proxy.
